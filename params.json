Simply add a line like `alias proj=\"cd /path/to/current/project\"` to your `.profile` file and the next time you log in you can do this:\r\n\r\n    $ proj\r\ninstead of this:\r\n\r\n    $ cd /path/to/current/project\r\nAnd you've just saved yourself 22 characters' worth of typing.\r\n\r\nBut what if you really don't want to edit your profile files every time you want to add or remove one of these aliases? Well, you can just move all the alias definitions into a file named, say `~./alias` and then you just add one line to `.profile`:\r\n\r\n    source ~/.alias\r\n\r\nAnd now you can just edit the `.alias` file. \r\n\r\nOr you can use `aka`.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ gem install aka\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. add the line `source ~/.alias` to your `.bash_profile` or `.profile` or `.bashrc`â€¦ basically whatever profile file you use on your system.\r\n2. run `aka -a hi \"echo Hi There!\"`\r\n3. type `source ~/.alias` to reload the aliases in your current session (or restart your session)\r\n4. type `hi`\r\n    1. Enjoy having your command line say `hi there` back to you\r\n5. run `aka -h` to see a full list of features.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPull requests and issues are very welcome.
